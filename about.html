            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
                Finance and accounting is said to need problem solving skills. I like to solve problems. 
                That's why I went to school, got a finance degree, and became a financial/accounting analyst.
                I learned a lot for the few years I did this for a living. I learned how to work on teams, learned how to communicate better,
                and learned how to look at things with a business mindset. I also learned that I really don't like accounting!
            </p>
            <p>
                One night when I was thinking about what I actually did like about my finance/accounting career, I stumbled on writing code.
                It checked all the boxes: building things, improving things, actual problem solving (finance/accounting say they solve problems, but they don't really).
                I decided to give it a shot at nights during my free time. Starting off with a free MOOC, I was instantly consumed. This was it, what I was made to be.
                I quit my job a few months later and enrolled at Oregon State to pursue a second BS in Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                That brings me to today, I'm nearing the completion of my degree, and ready to become a full-time software engineer.
            </p>
