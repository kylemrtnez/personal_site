            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
                Finance and accounting is said to need problem solving skills. I like to solve problems. 
                That's why I went to school, got a finance degree, and became a financial/accounting analyst.
                I learned a lot during my few financial analyst years. I learned how to work on teams, learned how to communicate better,
                and learned how to look at things with a business mindset. I also learned that I really don't like working in accounting/finance!
            </p>
            <p>
                One night when I was thinking about what I actually did like about my finance/accounting career, I stumbled on writing code.
                It checked all the boxes: building things, improving things, actual problem solving. 
                I decided to give it a shot at nights during my free time. Starting off with a free MOOC, I was instantly consumed. This was it, what I was made to be.
                I quit my job a few months later and enrolled at Oregon State to pursue a second BS in Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have now been a professional software engineer for a year, and I love going into work every day. I currently work at Charles Schwab, where I am doing full-stack work, modernizing/re-writing some of their legacy applications.
